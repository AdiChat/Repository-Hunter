### Making GitHub:octocat: more socially engaging 🎮 and fun 🍥 for all 👦 + 👧 + 👴 + 👶 + 🐮 + 🐦 + 🐱 ...<br>

![alt text](https://github.com/AdiChat/Repository-Hunter/blob/master/Preview/repository_hunter_1.3.gif " The view of the application")<br>

The application provides 6 kinds of services: 
* **Believe it or not**
* **Fun Facts**
* **Embeddable GitHub Contribution graph**
* **Compare two GitHub profiles**
* **Find the best coder at an organization**
* **Profile Presentation**

* The first feature is 🎉 **Believe it or not**🎉. It explores some of the mysterious corners at GitHub such as:
  * A man who has been committing for over **100 years**.
  * A **17-year-old issue** on 10-year-old GitHub using 13-year-old Git
  * A man with **no contribution graph**.
  * A human with a name that extends vertically indefinitely and much more. 

* The second engaging feature is the 🎉 **_Fun Facts_** 🎉. This meets the curiosity of a human to peek into the progress/ work accomplished by other users. Several engaging facts are presented which when observed closely provides deep insights into the mind of our fellow GitHub users. Some instances of engaging features are the list of most commented issues in GitHub, the list of oldest issues in GitHub, some of the most popular developers in GitHub and others. Some deep insights are:
   * The most commented issue has around **16565 comments** but the sad part is that it is a result of automation. 
   * The oldest unresolved bug is around **_16 years old_**. 
   * The most popular user is _Linus Torvalds_ with over **_46700 followers_** whereas he follows none (contrary to the assumption that "_`more users I follow, the more users will follow me`_") . 
   * A seemingly authentic issue has over **1915 comments** which is a discussion💭 over iCloudin, which is a tool to bypass iCloud and another issue addressing the same issue has over **1279 comments**. The strange part is there are only around 130 participants, a small number compared to other issues.
   * An issue over a project that won China 🌍 2014 State Science and Technology Prizes has over **1426 comments** with over **997 participants**. <br>
   and observations continue forever. ▶️ 

* The third one is 🎉 **_Embeddable GitHub Contribution graph_** 📅. This allows anyone to embed their contribution graph in any web application. Get your graph today! The best part is the even if your graph has been removed as happened with _Ciro Santilli_ several years ago, still, you will be able to **see your long lost graph** and save it for warm memories. Here is my saved contribution graph: <br>

* The fourth feature is 🎉 **GitHub Compare**. You can compare two GitHub accounts and find out who is :medal_sports:stronger💪 ? Yes, I know comparing two entities is not morally correct yet it is quite fun to see who's ahead? Take this as a disclaimer. 

* The fifth feature is 🎉 **GitHub master of the Organization** :1st_place_medal:. You can find the ranking of all public members of an organization and thus, there is an entity that dominates the ranking and hence, is the best 🏆 coder in the organization.

The top five contributors at **Google** are:

| Rank | Score | User |
|:----:|:-----:|:----:|
| 1 | 169.84 | [keyboardsurfer](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer) :1st_place_medal: 
| 2 | 136.01 | [spf13](https://github.com/spf13) 
| 3 | 126.47 | [philipwalton](https://github.com/philipwalton) 
| 4 | 119.82 | [igrigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik) 
| 5 | 119.42 | [jverkoey](https://github.com/jverkoey)

* The sixth one is a 🎉 **user profile presentation service** :person_fencing: where the public profile details such as some users following the concerned user, some users being followed by the concerned user, the language usage distribution and some public information is displayed in an exciting way. Check your profile [today](http://repository-hunter.herokuapp.com/).
